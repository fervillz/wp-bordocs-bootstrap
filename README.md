# Bootstrap libsass template

This is a template to start your own project that uses Grunt and libsass!

## Requirements

You'll need to have the following items installed before continuing.

  * [Node.js](http://nodejs.org): Use the installer provided on the NodeJS website.
  * [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/): Run `[sudo] npm install -g grunt-cli`
  * [Bower](http://bower.io): Run `[sudo] npm install -g bower`

## Quickstart

```bash
git clone git@github.com:zurb/foundation-libsass-template.git
npm install && bower install

or 

First, create a New Project folder. Then navigate into the directory where you want all the files to be created. cd\path\to\NewProjectRootDirectory

Get files in foundation
foundation new project_name --libsass

note: Since foundation offers fast files creation the above code is being used. Then just remove everything inside bower_components folder and install bootstrap using this code
bower install bootstrap-sass-official --save
```

While you're working on your project, run:

`grunt`

And you're set!
